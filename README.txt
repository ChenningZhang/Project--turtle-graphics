Project--turtle-graphics
========================
This project presents a simple language for drawing pictures that illustrates the power
of data abstraction and closure, and also exploits higher-order procedures in an essential
way. The language is designed to make it easy to experiment with patterns such as below,
which are composed of repeated elements that are shifted and scaled. In this language,
the data objects being combined are represented as procedures rather than as list structure.
Just as cons, which satisfies the closure property, allowed us to easily build arbitrarily
complicated list structure, the operations in this language, which also satisfy the closure
property, allow us to easily build arbitrarily complicated patterns.
